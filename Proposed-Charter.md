# Proposed Working Group Charter: IETF Coffee Standard (ICS)

The IETF Coffee Standard (ICS) Working Group is created to address the critical and long-standing issues surrounding coffee in the IETF ecosystem. Coffee is widely recognized as the fuel of Internet standards, and this working group will ensure that IETF meetings provide the best possible coffee experience for all participants.

ICS will establish guidelines, surveys, market analysis, recommendations, and policies to ensure that coffee at IETF meetings meets industry best practices. Additionally, the WG MAY also explore standardizing coffee supply chains, procurement, and sustainability concerns if deemed necessary.

## Scope

The ICS Working Group will work on:
- Defining coffee quality benchmarks and ensuring every IETF meeting serves high-quality coffee.
- Defining CAP
- Working with the broader IETF community to document coffee-related best practices
 
Out of scope:
- It is unclear if remote coffee strategy is also needed or not.
- Coffee for IRTF, IAB, and non-IETF participants

This working group may also consider the long-term feasibility of expanding the IETFâ€™s role in global coffee standardization efforts, including potential liaison efforts with the coffee industry.
